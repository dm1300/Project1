# Included is the main code for the project, the pseudo code to help write the program, and a word document with the states
# I keep all 3 open when writing the code so everything makes sense
# e.g. the pseudo code doesn't explain the state table, but the comments in the racket file does, and the pseudo code point 5. makes more sense with some visualisation of the states found in the word document
