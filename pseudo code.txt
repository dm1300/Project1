--------------------------------
(State LOOP)
1.check what state program is in
2.check what colour each light should be in the state
3.output what colour each light is
4.wait 2s (sleep 2)
5.check what colour each light is turning to in next state, if colour doesnt change then the light (a-d) stays the same for the in between state, if the colour changes from red>green then the colour of that light would be red and yellow, if it changes from green>red then the colour would change to yellow for the in between state
6.change states (if state <4 then state=state+1, else state=1) ;so just looping the state back to the first state once the 4th finishes
7.repeat
