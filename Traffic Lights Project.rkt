;to see what colour each light should be in the StateTable, the following function is used:
;(NO (NO (light a-d (NO (NO (state 1-4 StateTable))))))
;^^^where NO means not important, just used to navigate through the list

;e.g. :
;(first (rest (first (first (rest (first  StateTable))))))
;this outputs what light 'a' should be in the first state
